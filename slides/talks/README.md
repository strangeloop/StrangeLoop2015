## What's This?

This folder collects slides from the [Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com) 2015 [sessions](http://thestrangeloop.com/2015/sessions.html).

If you try to download slides and see a "Blob too big" error, then the file is too large for GitHub to serve through its web API. In that case, you should clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2015.git```

## Tell Me More!

Go to the [Coverage](https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2014/wiki/Coverage) wiki page for links to pictures, videos, blogs, and lots more.

## Will This Happen Again?

Strange Loop 2016 is scheduled for Sept 15-17, 2016 in St. Louis, MO, USA. Track it on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2016/strange-loop/) or join the [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dG_X-/). 

## The End.
